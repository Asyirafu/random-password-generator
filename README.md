# Random Password Generator – Firefox Extension

A simple Firefox extension that generates secure passwords on demand.  

I built this because I wanted a faster, more reliable way to create passwords when signing up for websites (like [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)) the built-in Firefox password generator wasn’t cutting it.  

This extension improved my workflow and is a small example of solving a real problem with a lightweight browser tool.
